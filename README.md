# SMACC

SMACC is an application written in Java that allows to classify microplastic particles into five classes according to their shape, texture and color. The classes are: fragment, pellet, line, tar and organic. The last two classes are not, strictly speaking, polymers but they can be found in the beaches so they are considered by the application. The application makes use as input of two images acquired with a high resolution scanner (for example, Epson Perfection V800): one transparency image captured with backlight illumination and one color image captured in reflective mode.
